# Developer Brief: Footprint Audit Wizard (60‑Minute Workforce Digital Footprint Lab)

## 1) Context and purpose

We are building a **single-session (≈60 minutes) digital literacy lab** for **workforce adults**, using **mixed browsers and machines** (Windows/macOS, Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari; some participants on mobile). Participants may be **anywhere in the world** and may be on **corporate-managed devices** with restrictions.

The lab’s purpose is to **surprise and educate** participants by making the “invisible” parts of digital tracking visible and measurable, while giving them a practical foundation for **digital hygiene**.

### What we want participants to experience

They should leave with:

1. A concrete, memorable understanding that digital footprint has layers:

   * **Public exposure** (what’s searchable)
   * **Data broker exposure** (people-search listings)
   * **Behavioral tracking** (third-party trackers)
   * **Identifier tracking** (cookies + fingerprints + device IDs)
   * **Breach exposure** (accounts leaked in incidents)
2. A “before/after” sense of impact for a few simple hygiene actions (e.g., clearing cookies, changing ad settings).
3. A personal **Footprint Report Card** they can save (PDF/HTML) with next steps.

### Critical boundaries (privacy + safety)

This lab is **self-audit only**:

* The tool must **not** facilitate searching for other people.
* The tool must **not** collect or transmit participants’ personal identifiers (name, email, phone, address, employer, etc.).
* The tool should not encourage participants to paste sensitive data anywhere (especially passwords).

We will **link to existing services** for measurement:

* **Blacklight** (web privacy inspector by The Markup) ([themarkup.org][1])
* **EFF Cover Your Tracks** (fingerprinting/tracking exposure test) ([coveryourtracks.eff.org][2])
* **Google “Results about you” / removal flow** (for personal info in Google Search) ([My Activity][3])
* **Have I Been Pwned** (breach exposure check / notifications) ([Have I Been Pwned][4])
* **Browser cookie clearing instructions** (official support pages) ([Google Help][5])
* **Ad personalization controls** (Google, Apple, Android) ([Google Help][6])
* Optional: **DuckDuckGo Email Protection** (email tracker removal concept demo) ([DuckDuckGo][7])
* Optional concept: **Global Privacy Control** (policy+tech “signal” idea) ([Global Privacy Control][8])
* Data brokers concept explainer: FTC people-search sites overview ([Consumer Advice][9])

---

## 2) Product deliverable

A lightweight web app called **Footprint Audit Wizard** that:

* Guides participants through the lab in a structured sequence
* Opens the relevant external tools/instructions in new tabs
* Prompts participants to record only **non-sensitive metrics** (counts, yes/no toggles, coarse categories)
* Produces a **downloadable report** (PDF and/or print-to-PDF friendly HTML)
* Stores progress **locally on the user’s device** (no sign-in; no backend required)

### Non-goals (explicit)

* Do **not** crawl websites or run headless scans ourselves (we will link to Blacklight, not reproduce it).
* Do **not** scrape or store the participant’s personal information.
* Do **not** build a data broker opt-out automation service.
* Do **not** provide “stealth” or evasion tooling; this is an education lab, not an operational privacy product.

---

## 3) Lab design: the 60-minute flow (what the wizard should enforce)

This should be a **single guided path** with a visible timer/progress bar and a “skip” option.

### Agenda (minute-by-minute)

**0–3 min — Welcome + safety**

* Explain self-audit rule
* Explain what data we store (counts only, local only)
* “Use Fictional Persona Mode” option for anyone uncomfortable

**3–13 min — Shock #1: Public exposure**

* Guided search prompts (self only) + Google removal tools
* Record: how many results looked like they contained personal contact info / address / relatives

**13–28 min — Shock #2: Tracker visibility**

* Run Blacklight on 1–2 familiar sites
* Record: # trackers, session recording present, keylogging present, fingerprinting flags, third-party cookies flags (as reported)

**28–38 min — Shock #3: Fingerprinting isn’t cookies**

* Run EFF Cover Your Tracks
* Record: “unique?” “tracking protection strong/weak?” (whatever summary the tool shows)

**38–48 min — Shock #4: Account & device identifiers**

* Check toggles for Google ad personalization, Apple personalized ads, Android advertising ID options, and iOS App Tracking Transparency (as applicable)
* Record: whether personalized ads are on/off; whether ad ID reset/deleted (if Android)

**48–57 min — Cleanup sprint**

* Clear cookies/site data using browser-specific official instructions
* OPTIONAL: enable a privacy-protective setting (e.g., block third-party cookies) if participant is comfortable
* Record: done/not done

**57–60 min — Report card + next steps**

* Generate downloadable report
* Show “Top 5 next actions” personalized from their responses

---

## 4) UX requirements

### Core screens

1. **Landing / consent & safety**

   * Short purpose statement
   * “Self-audit only”
   * “We don’t collect/store personal data; all results stay on your device.”
   * Mode toggle:

     * **My footprint**
     * **Fictional persona demo** (uses prefilled example inputs; no real searches required)

2. **Wizard steps (6 steps)**

   * Each step includes:

     * A 1–2 sentence explanation (plain language)
     * 1–3 external links (open in new tab)
     * “What to record” input section (counts and toggles only)
     * “Common pitfalls” collapsible (e.g., “this will log you out”)
     * “Next” button + “Skip” button

3. **Report Card**

   * Summary scores/tiles
   * “What this means” explanations
   * Personalized “Next Actions”
   * Download buttons: **Print/PDF**, **Download JSON** (optional)

### Interaction details

* External links must open with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
* Provide a persistent “panic/clear” option: **“Clear my lab data from this device”** (wipes local storage).

### Accessibility & usability

* WCAG-friendly (semantic headings, keyboard navigable, high contrast, no essential color-only meaning).
* Mobile responsive (participants might use phones for settings).

---

## 5) Data minimization: what we store

We store **only**:

* coarse counts (integers)
* yes/no/unknown toggles
* which device/browser they used (optional, from a small list)
* timestamp (optional)

We do **not** store:

* names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
* URLs they searched
* specific people-search sites where they found themselves
* screenshots
* anything pulled from external tools

### Suggested local JSON schema

(Developer can implement as TypeScript interface + localStorage key `footprintWizard:v1`.)

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "mode": "self|fictional",
  "device": {
    "type": "desktop|mobile|unknown",

    }
  }
}
```

## 6) Wizard step content (what the developer should implement)

### Step 0 — Welcome & safety (3 minutes)

**Copy intent (suggested):**

* “This lab helps you see what parts of your digital footprint are visible and trackable. You’ll use a few trusted public tools.”
* “Self-audit only: search your own identifiers or use Fictional Persona Mode.”
* “We never ask for your name/email/phone. You’ll only record counts and yes/no answers. Everything stays on your device.”

**UI elements:**

* Mode toggle: My footprint / Fictional persona
* Dropdown: device OS/browser (optional)
* Continue

---

### Step 1 — Public exposure (≈10 minutes)

**Concept to teach:** Some personal info is publicly discoverable via search; “privacy” isn’t only what you post.

**External links (open new tabs):**

* Google “Results about you” dashboard ([My Activity][3])
* Google help: find/remove personal contact info ([Google Help][10])

**In-wizard instructions:**

* Provide safe prompts like:

  * “Search your name + city”
  * “Search your email address”
  * “Search your phone number”
* Important: show warning text: “Don’t paste sensitive info into the wizard—only into your own browser/search engine.”

**Inputs to record:**

* `searchResultPagesWithPersonalInfo` (0,1,2,3,4,5+)
* `peopleSearchSitesFound` (yes/no/unsure)
* `googleResultsAboutYouVisited` (yes/no)
* `googleRemovalRequested` (yes/no/not applicable)

**Pitfall callouts:**

* “Search results vary by country/language.”
* “If you’re on a work computer, you may be logged into corporate Google accounts.”

---

### Step 2 — Tracker visibility with Blacklight (≈15 minutes)

**Concept to teach:** One normal webpage can load dozens of third parties; tracking isn’t just “cookies.”

**External link:**

* Blacklight tool landing page ([themarkup.org][1])

**In-wizard instructions:**

* Ask participants to run Blacklight on a **non-sensitive** site category:

  * “News” or “Shopping” recommended
  * Avoid health portals or internal company systems
* In Fictional Persona mode, provide an example site category and prefilled sample outputs (see Demo Mode section).

**Inputs to record (from Blacklight output screen):**

* `trackerCount` (number)
* `thirdPartyCookiesFlagged` (yes/no/unsure)
* `sessionRecordingFlagged` (yes/no/unsure)
* `keyLoggingFlagged` (yes/no/unsure)
* `fingerprintingFlagged` (yes/no/unsure)

**Pitfall callouts:**

* “Some sites block automated scanning; if it fails, try another site.”
* “Results are a snapshot; they can change day to day.”

---

### Step 3 — Fingerprinting (≈10 minutes)

**Concept to teach:** Clearing cookies ≠ not being identifiable. Fingerprinting can still make a browser unique.

**External links:**

* EFF Cover Your Tracks test ([coveryourtracks.eff.org][2])

**Inputs to record (based on the tool’s summary):**

* `browserUnique` (yes/no/unsure)
* `trackingProtection` (strong/partial/weak/unsure)

**Pitfall callouts:**

* “Uniqueness can change depending on extensions and settings.”
* “Private browsing often does not make your browser non-unique.”

---

### Step 4 — Account & device identifiers (≈10 minutes)

**Concept to teach:** Tracking also happens at the account/device level (ad personalization, device IDs, app tracking permissions).

**External links (show contextually depending on OS selection):**

* Google My Ad Center: personalized ads controls ([Google Help][6])
* Apple: control personalized ads ([Apple Support][11])
* Android: reset/delete advertising ID (official steps vary by version; provide link that describes reset/delete) ([Google Help][12])
* iOS App Tracking Transparency explainer (what the prompt means) ([Apple Support][13])

**Inputs to record:**

* `googlePersonalizedAds`: on/off/unsure/not used
* `applePersonalizedAds`: on/off/unsure/not applicable
* `androidAdvertisingIdAction`: reset/deleted/none/not applicable/unsure
* `iosATTSetting`: allow_apps_to_request / blocked / unsure / not applicable

**Pitfall callouts:**

* “Turning off personalized ads may not reduce the number of ads; it changes targeting.”
* “On managed devices, you may not be able to change some settings.”

---

### Step 5 — Cleanup sprint (≈9 minutes)

**Concept to teach:** Hygiene actions reduce persistence but don’t erase everything; still worthwhile.

**External links (browser-specific):**

* Chrome: clear cache/cookies ([Google Help][5])
* Firefox: clear cookies & site data ([Mozilla Support][14])
* Safari (iPhone): delete history/cache/cookies ([Apple Support][15])
* Microsoft Edge: manage/delete cookies ([Microsoft Support][16])

**Inputs to record:**

* `cookiesCleared` yes/no
* `thirdPartyCookiesBlockedOrLimited` yes/no/unsure
* `passwordHygieneActionTaken` yes/no/later
  (This is intentionally vague: e.g., “enabled MFA” / “updated a password” / “checked password manager”—do not capture details.)

**Pitfall callouts:**

* “Clearing cookies logs you out of sites.”
* “If you’re on a shared computer, clearing cookies is usually a good idea.”

---

### Step 6 — Report Card (≈3 minutes)

**Outputs:**

* A 1–2 page summary with:

  * The five footprint layers
  * Their recorded metrics
  * A short interpretation (“What your results suggest”)
  * A prioritized “Next Actions” list

**Download options:**

* “Print / Save as PDF”
* Optional: “Download JSON (my local lab data)”

---

## 7) Report Card logic (how to turn inputs into “wow”)

### Suggested visual structure

* **Tile row (4–6 tiles):**

  * “Public exposure signals”
  * “Tracking intensity”
  * “Fingerprint uniqueness”
  * “Account/device ads”
  * “Cleanup completed”
* **Interpretation section** (careful with claims):

  * Use probabilistic language: “This suggests…” not “This proves…”

### Suggested simple scoring (transparent, not gamed)

Do **not** present it as a precise privacy score. Present as **“signals”**.

Example:

* Public exposure signal: based on `searchResultPagesWithPersonalInfo` and `peopleSearchSitesFound`
* Tracking intensity: based on Blacklight `trackerCount` + flags
* Fingerprinting: if `browserUnique=yes`, show “Likely uniquely identifiable”
* Account/device: if personalized ads on, show “More profile-based targeting likely”
* Hygiene: if cookies cleared + third-party cookie settings changed, show “Reduced persistence”

### “Next Actions” personalization

Rules-based recommendations (examples):

* If `peopleSearchSitesFound=yes`: recommend FTC guidance on people-search sites and opt-outs ([Consumer Advice][9])
* If `browserUnique=yes`: recommend privacy-protective browsing habits and understanding fingerprinting (link back to EFF page) ([Electronic Frontier Foundation][17])
* If cookies not cleared: recommend doing it later with the browser link list ([Google Help][5])
* If breach check not done: recommend HIBP + notifications (without collecting email) ([Have I Been Pwned][4])

---

## 8) Demo mode (highly recommended)

Because corporate networks can block tools or slow scans, implement **Fictional Persona Mode** that:

* Never asks users to run real searches
* Provides **pre-filled example outputs** for each step (with “Try live tools anyway” as optional)

### Demo content

* Example Blacklight result: tracker count like 70; session recording “yes”; keylogging “no”; fingerprinting “yes” (purely illustrative)
* Example Cover Your Tracks: unique “yes”
* Example public exposure: 2 pages of results; people-search sites found “yes”

This ensures the lab still works even in restricted environments.

---

## 9) Technical architecture (keep it simple)

### Recommended implementation: Static SPA (no backend)

* Host as a static site (Netlify/Vercel/S3 or internal LMS)
* All state stored in `localStorage` (or `IndexedDB` if you prefer)
* Report generated client-side as HTML print view (and optionally PDF export)

Why:

* Global participants, mixed devices
* Minimizes privacy/security risk
* Avoids operational burden

### PDF generation

Option A (simplest): Create a print stylesheet and instruct users to “Print → Save as PDF”.
Option B: client-side PDF library (jsPDF / html2pdf). Either works; print-to-PDF is the least brittle.

### Security headers (if hosting yourselves)

* Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that disallows third-party scripts by default.
* No analytics scripts unless explicitly approved; if used, ensure they collect no PII.

### QA requirements

Test on:

* Chrome (Win/Mac)
* Edge (Win)
* Firefox (Win/Mac)
* Safari (macOS + iOS if possible)

---

## 11) Implementation milestones (pragmatic)

**Milestone 1 (MVP, 1–2 sprints)**

* Landing + safety + mode toggle
* 6-step wizard with external links
* Local storage persistence
* Report view + print stylesheet
* Clear-my-data button

**Milestone 2**

* Demo mode with prefilled sample results
* Simple rules-based “Next Actions”
* Optional JSON export

**Milestone 3 (optional, if you want class-level aggregation)**

* “Facilitator code” that lets participants optionally submit *only* their anonymized counts to an instructor endpoint
* This is optional and should default off.

---

## 12) Copy requirements (tone + pedagogy)

* Plain language, non-judgmental
* Avoid “you are being watched” melodrama; instead: “Here are the mechanisms; here’s what you can control.”
* Every “wow” moment must include a reality check:

  * “Snapshot, not a full census”
  * “Different laws/countries change what’s visible”
  * “Some tracking persists beyond cookies”

---

### Confidence

**High confidence** that this spec is buildable quickly as a static wizard and will deliver the “wow + hygiene foundation” learning outcomes for workforce adults. **Medium confidence** on how consistently external tools will behave across corporate networks—hence the strong recommendation for **Demo mode** as a reliability backstop.
