Based on my comprehensive audit of the codebase against the developer handoff specification, here's my prioritized list of improvements and fixes:

PRIORITY 1: Critical Missing Features
1.1 Account/Device Step - Missing Pitfall Callouts
Spec says:

"Turning off personalized ads may not reduce the number of ads; it changes targeting."
"On managed devices, you may not be able to change some settings."
Current: Only has 3 pitfalls, missing these two critical ones.

1.2 FictionalBanner - "Try live tools anyway" toggle visibility
Spec says: Demo mode should provide "Try live tools anyway" as optional for each step
Current: Toggle exists but steps don't conditionally show/hide external link cards based on this toggle - in fictional mode, external links are always visible.

PRIORITY 2: Missing Spec Requirements
2.1 Fingerprinting Step - Missing EFF Explainer Link
Spec link registry says: EFF explainer page: https://www.eff.org/pages/cover-your-tracks
Current: Only has the test link, not the educational explainer.

2.2 Report Card - "Next Actions" missing FTC people-search guidance
Spec says: If peopleSearchSitesFound=yes, recommend FTC guidance (https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-people-search-sites-sell-your-information)
Current: Next Actions mentions "FTC guide" but uses shortened URL, not the exact registry URL.

2.3 Welcome Page - Device/Browser Selection should be more clearly optional
Spec says: "Dropdown: device OS/browser (optional)"
Current: Shows "Optional: Help us show relevant instructions" but dropdowns don't clearly indicate they can be skipped - they default to "unknown" which is good.

PRIORITY 3: Content & Copy Improvements
3.1 Step 4 Missing Pitfall About Managed Devices
The spec explicitly mentions: "On managed devices, you may not be able to change some settings."

3.2 Cleanup Step - Missing "Password Hygiene" clarity
Spec says: This is intentionally vague: "enabled MFA" / "updated a password" / "checked password manager"—do not capture details.
Current: Label says "Did you check for breached accounts on Have I Been Pwned?" which is more specific than spec intends.

3.3 Report Card Tile Labels Don't Match Spec Exactly
Spec says: Tiles should be: "Public exposure signals", "Tracking intensity", "Fingerprint uniqueness", "Account/device ads", "Cleanup completed"
Current: Using "Public Exposure", "Trackers Found", "Browser Uniqueness", "Ad Personalization", "Cleanup Completed"

PRIORITY 4: Nice-to-Have Enhancements
4.1 DuckDuckGo Email Protection Link (Optional per spec)
Spec mentions: Optional concept demo for email tracker removal.

4.2 Global Privacy Control Link (Optional per spec)
Spec mentions: Optional concept: GPC "signal" idea.

4.3 Account/Device "What This Means" accordion missing in Report Card
Current: Has Public, Trackers, Fingerprint, Cleanup accordions but no Account/Device details accordion.
