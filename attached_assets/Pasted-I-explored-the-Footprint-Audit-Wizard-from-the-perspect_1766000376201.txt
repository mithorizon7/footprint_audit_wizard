I explored the Footprint Audit Wizard from the perspective of a first‑time user. The tool is a self‑guided, single‑session lab designed to help people understand the “layers” of their digital footprint and to see what kinds of data about them are visible or trackable online. Here’s what a new user would need to know to get the most out of it:

* **Purpose and Scope** – The wizard’s goal is to educate you about public exposure (information that appears in search results), data‑broker/people‑search exposure, behavioural tracking on websites, browser/device fingerprinting, account‑level identifiers (such as advertising IDs), and breach exposure. It does not search for anyone else, collect your personal identifiers, or encourage you to paste sensitive data; all data you record stays local on your device.

* **Starting the Lab** – The landing page lets you choose between **“My Footprint”** (a self‑audit using your own name) and **“Fictional Persona Demo”** (a pre‑filled example for practice). There are optional drop‑downs to specify your device type, operating system and browser so the tool can show relevant instructions. A warning reminds you that this is a self‑audit only and that the site will never ask for your name, email, or phone number.

* **Structure of the Lab** – The session is broken into a series of steps with an estimated time target for each. A progress bar at the top shows how far along you are. At any point you can click a “Clear my lab data” panic button to erase the session. Each step explains why that aspect of your footprint matters and then asks you to record findings or settings from an external tool.

* **Step 1 – Public Exposure** – You’re asked to search your own name (or use the fictional persona) to see how many search result pages contain personal information such as address or phone number and whether you appear on people‑search sites. It also asks whether you visited Google’s “Results about you” dashboard and if you requested removal of any search results. This step highlights that data brokers aggregate information from many sources and that even if you don’t post details about yourself, others may.

* **Step 2 – Tracker Visibility** – The wizard links to The Markup’s Blacklight tool and has you scan a website you visit often. You record the type of site, the number of trackers detected, whether third‑party cookies were flagged, and whether session recording, keylogging or fingerprinting was detected. The accompanying explanation notes that pages can load dozens of third‑party scripts that record your behaviour without your knowledge.

* **Step 3 – Fingerprinting** – You are directed to run EFF’s Cover Your Tracks test to see if your browser’s fingerprint is unique and what level of tracking protection your browser provides. The wizard reminds you that clearing cookies doesn’t prevent identification, because a combination of settings and hardware characteristics can uniquely identify your device.

* **Step 4 – Account & Device Identifiers** – This step addresses advertising identifiers and ad‑personalization settings. It asks whether Google personalized ads and Apple personalized ads are turned on or off and what your iOS App Tracking Transparency setting is. The tool emphasizes that even if you block trackers at the website level, your accounts and devices may still share data with advertisers via built‑in identifiers.

* **Step 5 – Cleanup Sprint** – You are encouraged to take immediate “hygiene” actions: clearing your cookies and site data, enabling blocking of third‑party cookies, and performing some form of password hygiene (e.g., checking for breaches via Have I Been Pwned, enabling two‑factor authentication or updating a password). There’s an important warning that clearing cookies will log you out of sites, so you should be prepared with your passwords or a password manager.

* **Step 6 – Report Card** – The final step generates a summary report. It consolidates your recorded findings into categories such as public exposure signals, tracking intensity, fingerprint uniqueness, account/device ads status, and whether cleanup actions were completed. Collapsible sections provide more detail; for example, under “Public Exposure Details” the fictional demo shows that two pages contained personal information, people‑search sites listed the persona, Google’s removal dashboard was visited, and no removals were requested. Another section (“Cleanup Actions Taken”) confirms whether cookies were cleared and third‑party cookies blocked. The report also lists “Your Next Actions” as a checklist of recommended steps (e.g., request removal of personal info in Google results, remove yourself from people‑search sites, install a content blocker, use a browser with stronger tracking protection, disable personalized ads, clear cookies, enable third‑party cookie blocking). You can print/save the report as a PDF or download it as a JSON file; these options keep the data local.

In summary, a new user should understand that this wizard is meant for self‑auditing their online exposure. They’ll need to be prepared to run a few external privacy tools (Blacklight, Cover Your Tracks, Google’s “Results about you,” and possibly Have I Been Pwned) and to record simple metrics or yes/no answers about what those tools reveal. The lab walks them through each layer of their digital footprint, explains why it matters, and ends with a personalized report and a to‑do list. Being aware of the optional device/OS/browser selection at the outset, the self‑audit boundary, and the fact that clearing cookies logs them out of websites will help participants use the tool smoothly.
