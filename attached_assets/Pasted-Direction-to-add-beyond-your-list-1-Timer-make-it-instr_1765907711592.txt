Direction to add (beyond your list)
1) Timer: make it instructional, not just decorative

What you want is a pacing tool that gently keeps the room together.

Add these behaviors:

Global countdown to 60:00 (or whatever facilitator sets).

Per-step target time (e.g., “Target: 10 min”) + “Time remaining in lab”.

Persist the timer state in localStorage so refresh doesn’t reset (you already have session recovery—tie into that).

Provide a “Pause” toggle (optional) only in facilitator mode; otherwise it becomes fiddly for learners.

Acceptance criteria

On any step, users see:

Step X of Y

% progress

Time remaining in lab: mm:ss

Target time for this step: N min

Refresh restores within ±2s.

No PII stored to support this (just timestamps/elapsed seconds).

2) “Skip” needs semantics and report consequences

A skip button isn’t just navigation—your report and next actions must reflect it.

Spec the behavior:

Clicking Skip marks the step as skipped=true and advances.

Report card shows Skipped clearly per section.

Next Actions includes “You skipped X; do this later” with the relevant link list.

Acceptance criteria

Skip exists on every step except Welcome (and possibly Report).

Report includes a “Skipped items” section if any step skipped.

3) Fictional mode should be a complete alternate experience

Right now you’ve got a banner. The goal is: participants can complete the whole lab without doing any real searching.

Do this:

When Fictional mode is enabled:

Prefill every step’s form fields with believable sample values.

Default external links to “Optional” and collapse them behind Try live tools anyway.

Provide a one-click “Reset demo values” and “Switch to My Footprint”.

Acceptance criteria

In Fictional mode, a participant can click Next through every step and generate a report without typing anything.

There is a clearly labeled toggle: Try live tools anyway (off by default).

Switching modes prompts: “This will clear current entries—continue?”

4) Add a reliability fallback when external tools are blocked

Corporate networks and privacy tools will break some links (Blacklight may fail; EFF may be blocked).

Add a “If the tool doesn’t load” fallback block on each tool step:

“Try a different site category”

“Try on your phone (mobile hotspot)”

“Use Fictional mode to continue the learning”

Acceptance criteria

Every external-tool step contains a short fallback section (collapsible is fine).

5) Data minimization: add a “PII guardrail” UX pattern

Even if you tell users not to enter personal info, some will.

Add:

Form labels that explicitly say “Do not enter names/emails/phones here.”

For any free-text fields (ideally none), add a warning and validation (“Looks like an email/phone—please don’t enter that.”)

Acceptance criteria

No fields accept or encourage raw identifiers.

If you have any free-text input, it blocks common PII patterns or at least warns.

6) Move HIBP into the flow as a 2-minute micro-step (not buried)

I’d add one tiny “Breach exposure check” card either:

at the end of Cleanup, or

as a mini-panel in Report Card (“Optional: check breach exposure”).

Why: it’s conceptually its own layer (breach footprint), and many people will skip if it feels like “more cleanup.”

Acceptance criteria

HIBP link appears with a short explanation + explicit “optional” label.

The wizard never asks users to enter their email into the wizard.

7) Print stylesheet: treat it as a deliverable, not a button

You already have window.print(). That’s not “PDF-ready” until the print CSS is correct.

Print CSS should:

Hide nav/buttons/inputs; show answers as plain text.

Add page breaks between major sections.

Include timestamp + “local-only” disclaimer.

Avoid color-dependent meaning.

Acceptance criteria

Print preview shows a clean 1–2 page report (no UI chrome).

Works on Chrome + Edge + Safari.

8) i18n: be intentional about scope

Given “global workforce adults,” full i18n is valuable—but it’s also a rabbit hole.

My direction:

Do not partially translate the core flow long-term. Either:

(A) commit to i18n for all user-facing strings in steps + report, or

(B) keep everything English-only for MVP and remove “half-i18n” to avoid false expectations.

Acceptance criteria

Chosen option is consistent across the entire wizard.

Your priority order is correct — here’s the “do this next” sequence

If you want maximum impact per unit effort:

Timer + time remaining (core pacing + spec compliance)

Skip (with report semantics)

Fictional mode prefill + “try live tools anyway” (reliability + corporate network proofing)

Collapsible pitfalls + external-tool fallback blocks

Cleanup links (browser-specific) + HIBP + FTC link rules in Next Actions

Report disclaimers + print stylesheet

i18n decision + implementation

So yes: start working through Priority 1 first, exactly as your note suggests—but implement timer + skip + fictional prefill in a way that also sets you up for the rest (especially report semantics and session recovery).

Two small additions I’d explicitly ask your dev to include

A “Clear my lab data” action that wipes localStorage and returns to Welcome (sounds like you have PanicButton—make sure it also clears timer state and step completion state).

A lightweight QA checklist: Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari + mobile responsiveness + “tool blocked” scenario.
